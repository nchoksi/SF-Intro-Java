Date Lab:

Create a Date class and another class (e.g. UseDate) that you will use to
exercise Date and objects of Date type.

In the Date class:
- define the following methods:
  - isLeapYear
  - daysInMonth (month 3 -> 31, month 4 -> 30, month 2 year 2000 -> 29, month 2 year 1999 -> 28
  (9, 4, 6, 11 -> 30
  2 -> 28/29 depending on leap year,
  otherwise 31)
  - monthName
  - dayName
Question: do these seem to be instance methods or static methods?

Write some code in the exercise class (UseDate) to verify these methods work properly

Then:
- define three instance fields in the class: day, month, and year
(how should "changeable" -aka mutable- fields be declared stylistically?)
- define a "constructor" that verifies if the day, month, year values proposed
are valid, and if so initializes the fields, otherwise throws an exception
- write some test code to verify correct rejection of bad values.

Define these methods in the Date class:
- asText
  (verify this against the objects you created in your test of the constructor)
- dayOfWeek
- tomorrow

Question, again, are these instance methods or static methods?

Write code to exercise the new methods.
